// Approach: 
// Use a for loop to iterate from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of rows. This loop will ensure to print each row of the pattern.
// The inner loop will run for i times and print alphabets from 'A' to 'A' + (N-row number-1).
// After completing a row give a line break, to make sure next row gets printed as well.
